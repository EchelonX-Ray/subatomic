**The Subatomic project Contribution Policy and Recommended Contribution Methods**  
  
**Policy**  
I, Michael T. Kloos, alias Echelon X-Ray, as creater, copyright owner,  
developer, and maintainer of this project, am the final authority to  
all aspects of this project including what is accepted as a contribution.  
All persons contributing to this project must surrender all copyright  
ownership to me of the material that they contribute.  Such contributing  
persons must also certify and affirm that they do have the authority  
to make such a surrender of copyright ownership.  This policy is in  
place to avoid fragmentaion of copyright ownership for the project.  
  
**Recommended Methods of Contribution**  
How you submit contributions to me is largely up to you.  But the  
recommended method is to make a pull request to my github repo.  
Pull requests should be made to the "devel" branch.  If I decide I  
would like to merge your changes, I will contact you via the E-Mail  
address attached to your git commit to verfiy your surrender of all  
copyright ownership per the above paragraph.  I will keep these E-mails  
as a matter of record in case of dispute.  An alternative method for  
submitting contributions is to E-mail me directly your git diff or  
patch files.  In this case, I will credit and reference you by E-mail  
address and Name, in the git commit containing your changes.  Again,  
should I decide to accept your changes in the first place, I will  
contact you back directly via E-mail to confirm your surrender of all  
copyright ownership.  Regardless of the way you submit contributions,  
I will not accept contributions which fail to verify transfer of  
copyright ownership to me.  Contributions which meet this standard may  
still be refused for any reason.  It is also possible, only a part  
and/or modified version of your contribution may by accepted.  In this  
case, I will try to split this up across 2 seperate commits to keep the  
record clear of who made what changes.
